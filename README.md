2. High-paying salary
The earning potential of technical roles proves one of the most popular benefits of software engineering. Recent research by employment agency Reed found that in the UK, the average annual salary for a software engineer is more than £57,000 (Reed, 2024).

Average salaries for the role of software engineer are much higher than in other professions due to the specialist skills and advanced technical knowledge required. As global industries expand their digital footprint, technology expertise becomes increasingly valuable, creating market demand for these skills.

3. Better job prospects
If you're wondering why software engineering appeals to so many students, it can be helpful to understand the breadth of job roles it can lead to. Graduates with degrees in this field can go on to work in different areas of technology and explore their individual interests, such as app development or cyber security.

With their skills in high demand, software engineers have strong employment and long-term career prospects. They can be selective about the industry they work in and the size of the company they choose, whether it’s a multinational healthcare provider or an Esports start-up. 

As your skills develop, you could progress to higher levels of seniority or become subject matter experts in specific disciplines. Both routes offer rewarding long-term career advancement opportunities.

4. Problem-solving
Do you enjoy solving challenges? Software engineering requires a variety of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Overcoming complex challenges is at the heart of this discipline, requiring a methodical, logic-based approach to identifying technical issues and improving processes.

Software engineers enjoy highly rewarding careers, as they are directly responsible for technological advancement. You could design innovative, creative solutions to complex problems.

5. Scalability and flexibility
Software engineering is critical in supporting business growth and innovation. As businesses grow, so do the needs of their software systems. Increased numbers of users may be accessing systems more regularly, and system requirements may evolve. A good software engineer recognises these needs and will design with scalability in mind, so that systems can handle an increased load without  affecting performance. Their design approach must also support the addition of new features, known in software engineering as flexibility.

6. Global reach and accessibility
Software engineering benefits many aspects of digital connectivity and inclusivity. Increased access to the internet and mobile technologies has grown the reach of digital software, making it readily available to billions of people. 

As technology adoption increases, you could have an important role to play in driving accessibility by considering factors such as language, design requirements, and specific user needs. This could be achieved through applying inclusive design principles, implementing screen-reading technology, or developing a mobile app that works without an internet connection.

 7. Leveraging technology
A software engineer has a large virtual toolbox of technologies that enable them to design innovative solutions. Using your critical thinking skills and technological expertise, you can create software systems that drive economic and societal progress.
Such tools include:
Programming languages, such as Python and JavaScript.
Frameworks such as React and Django, used for building applications and user interfaces, such as React, Angular and Django.
Libraries of software and programming languages such as Pandas, NumPy and TensorFlow.
Development methodologies, including Agile, Scrum and DevOps.

**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**

1. Programming Langauge :  Programming Language like Pascal, Fortran and C were developed
2. Software engineering as displine was established.
3. Methods - Agile methodologies 

**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**

Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**

Agile is an iterative approach to software development, emphasizing flexibility and collaboration among cross-functional teams. It focuses on delivering small, incremental releases, adapting to changes throughout the development process. 
In contrast, Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Changes are difficult to incorporate once a phase is completed. Agile promotes adaptability and customer feedback, while Waterfall provides a structured plan but may struggle with accommodating changes late in the development cycle.
When it comes to software development methodologies, Agile and Waterfall are two prominent approaches that offer distinct advantages and challenges. Understanding the key characteristics, pros, and cons of each methodology is crucial for choosing the most suitable approach for your project.

**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**

Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**

Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Strategies for Overcoming Challenges: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


**#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering**


**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**

Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models

**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective**.
'Tell me about cats,' the AI might give a general answer. 
But if you ask, 'Tell me about the history of domestic cats,' you'll get a more focused response."
